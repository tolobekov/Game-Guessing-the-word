# Game-Guessing-the-word
It is a command-line game that selects a random word of a given length from a file called "words.txt" and allows the player to guess the word letter by letter. The player has a limited number of misses, which can be modified by selecting the appropriate option from the game menu.

To use the project, you can compile the provided C code into an executable file using a C compiler such as gcc, and then run the resulting executable file in a command prompt or terminal. Before running the program, make sure that the "words.txt" file is in the same directory as the executable file.
